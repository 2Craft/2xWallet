## FAQ

#### How does it work?

The programm uses the mnemoric Phrase (12 Words) to create a wallet and then Checks the balance. If the balance is >0, it will save in hits.txt and your Discord Webhook gets a Hit notifycation!

#### How to withdraw my Hit

You get 2 Options to withdraw:

#### Private KEY
Simply download exodus wallet on your PC/Laptop and click on your BTC Wallet. Then Click on the tree dots and click on "move founds". Paste your private key from hits.txt in and you are done!

#### Mnemoric Phrase
Just login at Exodus/Metamask with the 12 Words mnemoric phrase and send the BTC to your main wallet.
