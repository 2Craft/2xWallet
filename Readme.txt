Config Tutorial:
[main]
useConfig = False/True
threads = 1-100 (you can use more but it need more proxys and CPU/RAM
webhook = https://discord.com/api/webhooks/... Your discord webhook
miner = btc/ltc/eth (Only btc is working rn, we are working on the others)

[optional]
useProxy = False/True
changeProxyRatio = 1-100 (Try yourself, but i would recommend 10or20)
showOnlyHits = False/True

-------------
I recommend you to use proxys and a webhook :)
good luck!
